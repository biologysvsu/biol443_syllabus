# Final Bioinformatics Project Guidelines and Rubric

## **Objective**
Work in groups of three to design and complete a bioinformatics project related to topics covered in the course syllabus. The goal is to address a biological question using bioinformatics tools and data, then present your findings in a 10-minute presentation.

---

## **Project Requirements**

1. **Problem Statement**
   - Clearly define the biological problem or question your project addresses.
   - Clearly state your hypotheses (most likely answer to the problem).
   - Explain why this problem is significant.
   - Define the goal of your project in relation to the problem.
   - List specific objectives that will help achieve this goal.
     
2. **Connection to Course Topics**
   - Demonstrate how your project builds on the concepts and tools covered in class.
   - Example topics include:
     - Sequence alignment or BLAST searches
     - Phylogenetic analysis
     - RNA structure prediction
     - Gene annotation or analysis
     - etc
       
3. **Data and Database**
   - Specify the target organism and type of data used (e.g., genomic sequences, protein structures, ecological data).
   - You may not subsample files for your final project.
   - Include details on sample size and replicates.
   - Identify the database(s) where data was retrieved (e.g., NCBI, UniProt, ENSEMBL).

4. **Methods and Tools**
   - Highlight the bioinformatics tools, algorithms, or workflows applied for data analysis.
   - Specify the computing resources used and the time required for processing.
   - Describe any strategies to optimize performance, such as multi-threading, parallelization, or loops.
   - Justify your choice of methods: why is your workflow efficient and appropriate for the problem?

5. **Results and Visualizations**
   - Present findings using clear and relevant visualizations (e.g., graphs, sequence alignments, phylogenetic trees).
   - Make sure the visuals are professional and enhance the interpretation of your results.
   - Make sure your visuals are properly labeled and have a description/legend.
   - All visuals must be original or properly processed—no cropped, distorted, or unrefined images.
   - Unprocessed screenshots, poorly cropped images, or visuals requiring further editing will received a zero.
   - Make sure fonts in figures are readable.
   - Figures must be publication quality—avoid blurry, pixelated, or low-resolution images.
  
6. **Conclusions**
   - Summarize the key findings and their biological significance.
   - Clearly state whether your data supported the hypothesis.
   - Discuss future directions

## **Presentation Format**

- **Time Limit**: 8 minutes, followed by 2 minutes of Q&A.

**Suggested Slide Structure**:
1. Title slide with group member names.
2. Problem statement and relevance to course topics.
3. Data and methods used (brief overview).
4. Key findings with visualizations.
5. Conclusion and future directions.

|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Introduction**       | Clearly defines the biological problem and its significance; relates directly to course topics; engages audience creatively. | Clearly defines the problem and its significance; engages the audience moderately well. | Introduces the problem but lacks clarity or connection to the course. | Does not clearly state the problem or its significance; lacks engagement. |
| **Data and Database**  | Describes the data type and source (e.g., database) clearly and precisely; data is appropriate for the project. | Data source and type are described; minor gaps in clarity or appropriateness. | Mentions data and source but lacks details or the relevance is unclear. | Does not adequately describe data or fails to use appropriate sources. |
| **Methods**            | Clear and accurate description of tools, algorithms, or workflows; methods are well-suited to address the problem. | Methods are described and mostly appropriate; some details could be clearer. | Basic mention of tools or workflows; lacks explanation or appropriateness. | Tools or methods are missing, unclear, or poorly chosen.            |
| **Results and Visuals**| Results are clearly presented using professional and relevant visualizations; visuals enhance interpretation. | Results are presented with relevant visuals; minor issues with clarity or relevance. | Results are incomplete or visualizations are unclear or poorly chosen. | Results are unclear, and visuals are missing or do not relate to the content. |
| **Conclusion**         | Strong summary ties back to the problem and results; includes reflections or implications for future research. | Clear summary of findings; mentions implications but lacks depth or creativity. | Summarizes findings but does not connect well to the problem or future work. | Conclusion is missing or fails to connect findings to the problem or next steps. |

### **Physical Presentation and Delivery (10 points)**

| **Criterion**         | **Exemplary (2 pts)**                                                                  | **Proficient (1.5 pts)**                                                     | **Developing (1 pt)**                                                    | **Novice (0.5 pts)**                                                |

## **Additional Notes for Students**

- **Data and tools**: Make sure you explain *why* you chose specific datasets and tools, not just what they are.
- **Visualizations**: Use visualizations like sequence alignments, phylogenetic trees, or expression plots to communicate results effectively.
- **Relevance to course topics**: Stay focused on the bioinformatics methods and topics discussed in class.
- **Practice**: Rehearse as a group to refine timing, transitions, and overall delivery.
