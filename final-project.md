# Final Bioinformatics Project Guidelines and Rubric

## **Objective**
Work in groups of three to design and complete a bioinformatics project related to topics covered in the course syllabus. The goal is to address a biological question using bioinformatics tools and data, then present your findings in a 10-minute presentation.

---

## **Project Requirements**

1. **Problem Statement**
   - Clearly define the biological problem or question your project addresses.
   - Explain why this problem is significant and how it relates to course topics.

2. **Data and Database**
   - Specify the type of data used (e.g., genomic sequences, protein structures, ecological data).
   - Identify the database(s) where data was retrieved (e.g., NCBI, UniProt, ENSEMBL).

3. **Methods and Tools**
   - Highlight the bioinformatics tools, algorithms, or workflows applied for data analysis.
   - Provide a brief explanation of why these methods were chosen.

4. **Results and Visualizations**
   - Present findings using clear and relevant visualizations (e.g., graphs, sequence alignments, phylogenetic trees).
   - Ensure visuals are professional and enhance the interpretation of your results.

5. **Connection to Course Topics**
   - Demonstrate how your project builds on the concepts and tools covered in class.
   - Example topics include:
     - Sequence alignment or BLAST searches
     - Phylogenetic analysis
     - RNA structure prediction
     - Gene annotation or analysis

## **Rubric for Bioinformatics Project Presentation**

### **Presentation Content (10 points)**

| **Criterion**         | **Exemplary (2 pts)**                                                                 | **Proficient (1.5 pts)**                                                      | **Developing (1 pt)**                                                    | **Novice (0.5 pts)**                                                |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Introduction**       | Clearly defines the biological problem and its significance; relates directly to course topics; engages audience creatively. | Clearly defines the problem and its significance; engages the audience moderately well. | Introduces the problem but lacks clarity or connection to the course. | Does not clearly state the problem or its significance; lacks engagement. |
| **Data and Database**  | Describes the data type and source (e.g., database) clearly and precisely; data is appropriate for the project. | Data source and type are described; minor gaps in clarity or appropriateness. | Mentions data and source but lacks details or the relevance is unclear. | Does not adequately describe data or fails to use appropriate sources. |
| **Methods**            | Clear and accurate description of tools, algorithms, or workflows; methods are well-suited to address the problem. | Methods are described and mostly appropriate; some details could be clearer. | Basic mention of tools or workflows; lacks explanation or appropriateness. | Tools or methods are missing, unclear, or poorly chosen.            |
| **Results and Visuals**| Results are clearly presented using professional and relevant visualizations; visuals enhance interpretation. | Results are presented with relevant visuals; minor issues with clarity or relevance. | Results are incomplete or visualizations are unclear or poorly chosen. | Results are unclear, and visuals are missing or do not relate to the content. |
| **Conclusion**         | Strong summary ties back to the problem and results; includes reflections or implications for future research. | Clear summary of findings; mentions implications but lacks depth or creativity. | Summarizes findings but does not connect well to the problem or future work. | Conclusion is missing or fails to connect findings to the problem or next steps. |

### **Physical Presentation and Delivery (10 points)**

| **Criterion**         | **Exemplary (2 pts)**                                                                  | **Proficient (1.5 pts)**                                                     | **Developing (1 pt)**                                                    | **Novice (0.5 pts)**                                                |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Time Management**    | Presentation fits within the time limit (within 10 seconds).                           | Slightly over or under time (within 30 seconds).                            | Over or under time by up to 1 minute.                                    | Substantially over or under time by more than 1 minute.             |
| **Visual Aids**        | Slides are clear, professional, and directly support the presentationâ€™s content; minimal text with strong visuals. | Slides are clear but may have minor issues like excessive text or clutter. | Slides are somewhat cluttered or poorly organized; visuals are weak.     | Slides are unclear, poorly designed, or distracting.                |
| **Vocal Delivery**     | Clear, confident voice with appropriate pacing and emphasis; technical terms are pronounced correctly. | Voice is clear but pacing or volume is inconsistent; some minor pronunciation issues. | Voice is uneven or difficult to hear; lacks proper pacing or variation.  | Voice is unclear or monotone; mispronounces terms frequently.       |
| **Engagement**         | Maintains eye contact; uses gestures and body language naturally; engages audience effectively. | Maintains occasional eye contact; gestures are adequate but not impactful.  | Rarely maintains eye contact; gestures or body language are distracting.  | Reads from notes; lacks eye contact or gestures.                    |
| **Team Contribution**  | All members contribute equally and demonstrate clear understanding of their roles and the project. | All members contribute but roles or understanding are slightly uneven.      | One member dominates the presentation; uneven contributions.             | Some members do not participate or demonstrate understanding.       |

## **Additional Notes for Students**

- **Data and tools**: Ensure you explain *why* you chose specific datasets and tools, not just what they are.
- **Visualizations**: Use visualizations like sequence alignments, phylogenetic trees, or expression plots to communicate results effectively.
- **Relevance to course topics**: Stay focused on the bioinformatics methods and topics discussed in class.
- **Practice**: Rehearse as a group to refine timing, transitions, and overall delivery.
