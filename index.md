## COURSE DESCRIPTION
A detailed study of methods used in bioinformatics and the application of bioinformatics to modern biology. Topics include accessing public databases to acquire data, genomic technologies & data analysis, phylogenetic inference using parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches, phylogenetic comparative methods, and protein modeling, visualization & in-silico mutagenesis

## LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
- Navigate Linux operating systems and apply basic commands for file management and scripting.
- Understand and apply methods for acquiring and analyzing biological data from public databases.
- Develop a complete bioinformatics pipeline for a research problem.
- Present and teach a tutorial on bioinformatics software to peers

## MATERIALS REQUIRED
### Laptop Requirements: 
Students must must bring a laptop to every class meeting, including exams (practical). No reminders will be sent, and students should not email the instructor about forgotten laptops. Computers minimum requirements are:
- Operating System: Windows (10 or above) or macOS.
- RAM: Minimum of 4 GB.
- Chromebooks are **not acceptable**.
### Required Software:
- Open a [GitHub](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home) account using your svsu email.
- Download and Install [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) (Windows users only).

- Responsibility: Delays or inability to complete work due to the absence of a laptop will not be excused after this deadline.
## MAKEUP WORK AND ATTENDANCE POLICY
Students are expected to attend all scheduled classes and complete assignments on time. To accommodate unforeseen circumstances, the lowest grade in both the homework and in-class participation categories will be dropped. No makeup assignments or in-class participation grades will be allowed without proper documentation of emergencies (e.g., medical or legal).
Students should utilize the flexibility of the dropped grades to manage minor conflicts or emergencies without contacting the instructor. Routine makeup requests will not be entertained. In cases of documented emergencies, communication must be clear and timely.
## GRADING POLICY
Students will be assessed based on exams, in-class assignments, homework, tutorials, and the capstone project. Attendance and participation are integral to the learning process, and missing class will directly impact in-class participation points. Participation will be tracked through interactions on GitHub and active engagement in class discussions.
The following grading scale will be used in this course:
