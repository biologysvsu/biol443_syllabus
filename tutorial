# Tutorial Workshop Assignment Guidelines and Rubric

## **Objective**
Students will work in groups of five to design and deliver a 30-minute tutorial workshop on a bioinformatics software tool assigned by the instructor. The workshop should help peers learn the software through a combination of clear instructions, practical examples, and hands-on activities. Students are encouraged to use Google and ChatGPT as resources to build their tutorials.

---

## **Assignment Requirements**

1. **Software Familiarization**
   - Each group must become proficient with their assigned software.
   - Use online resources, including tutorials, documentation, and external help (e.g., Google, ChatGPT), to learn the software.

2. **Tutorial Design**
   - Create a step-by-step tutorial for the software, written in simple, clear language.
   - Include mock or real datasets to demonstrate software functionality.
   - Provide clear instructions for setup and use to ensure a successful experience for peers.

3. **Workshop Delivery**
   - Present a 30-minute tutorial workshop during your assigned class session.
   - Engage peers with interactive elements (e.g., live demonstrations, Q&A, or hands-on exercises).

4. **Documentation**
   - Share a written tutorial with step-by-step instructions and dataset links at least 48 hours before the presentation.
   - Include screenshots or visuals where necessary to clarify instructions.

5. **Logistics and Preparation**
   - Plan how to assist students who may get stuck during the workshop.
   - Ensure minimal time is spent on setup by providing clear instructions and troubleshooting tips beforehand.

6. **Team Collaboration**
   - Divide responsibilities among group members for research, preparation, and delivery.
   - Ensure equal participation in both the creation of the tutorial and its presentation.

## **Sign-Up Process**
- Tutorials will cover specific software tools assigned by the instructor (see syllabus for details).
- Students will sign up for tutorials on a first-come, first-serve basis.
- Only one group may present on each software tool.
